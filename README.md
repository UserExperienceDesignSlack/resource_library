# Designer Hangout Resource Library
Creating a free, open source library of the tools and links we discuss in designer hangout

## What is this?
An open source library of tools and links discussed at [The User Experience Designer's Slack](https://userexperiencedesign.slack.com/). We're a group of UX practitioners who are trying to build a central location to house our experience and knowledge on the incredible array of tools available to us.

## JS libraries:
* [Faceted Search Library](http://eikes.github.io/facetedsearch/): Most useful for generating tags. We would need to generate a robust schema up front that had all of our information types.
* [List.js Search](http://www.listjs.com/examples/existing-list): Seems more flexible and open - but not as powerful unless we can figure out some way to inject tags directly into the search function (It's really apparent I have no idea what I'm talking about, isn't it)
